# Little Cards

Little Cards is a great way to show off those pesky referral codes every startup in existence gives you. Whether it is on your personal site, your blog, or somewhere else on the web, Little Cards will fit right in.

## Built on Bootstrap

Little Cards are built on bootstrap, so you can plop them in your code quickly. You'll need to include our minified style sheet, but that's easy to do.

## Alternatively...

That said, sometimes messing around with CSS classes and images can be annoying. I recommend you copy the code using your browser's HTML Inspector. Once I figure out how to copy html code, that'll be fixed ðŸ˜„
